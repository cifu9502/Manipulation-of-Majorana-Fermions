For an impurity described by the Anderson impurity model, we show that the problem maps onto a variant of the interacting resonant two-level model which, in turn, maps onto the ferromagnetic Kondo model. Both magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities are considered. For magnetic impurities, an analysis relying on bosonization and the numerical renormalization group shows that the system flows to a fixed point characterized by a residual ln2 entropy and anisotropic static and dynamical impurity magnetic susceptibilities. For nonmagnetic impurities, the system flows instead to a fixed point with no residual entropy and we find diamagnetic impurity response at low temperatures. We comment on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for problems with nonstandard conduction band continua and on the differences which arise when we describe the impurities by either Anderson or Kondo impurity models.},

	abstract = {Topological quantum computation has emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as non-Abelian anyons, meaning that they obey non-Abelian braiding statistics. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations that are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles and then measuring the multiquasiparticle states. The fault tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the nonlocal encoding of the quasiparticle states, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the ν=5∕2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and thin-film superconductors. In this review article, current research in this field is described, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. Both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject are addressed, using the ν=5∕2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

	abstract = {A possible sighting of Majorana states
Nearly 80 years ago, the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana proposed the existence of an unusual type of particle that is its own antiparticle, the so-called Majorana fermion. The search for a free Majorana fermion has so far been unsuccessful, but bound Majorana-like collective excitations may exist in certain exotic superconductors. Nadj-Perge et al. created such a topological superconductor by depositing iron atoms onto the surface of superconducting lead, forming atomic chains (see the Perspective by Lee). They then used a scanning tunneling microscope to observe enhanced conductance at the ends of these chains at zero energy, where theory predicts Majorana states should appear.
Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 547
Majorana fermions are predicted to localize at the edge of a topological superconductor, a state of matter that can form when a ferromagnetic system is placed in proximity to a conventional superconductor with strong spin-orbit interaction. With the goal of realizing a one-dimensional topological superconductor, we have fabricated ferromagnetic iron (Fe) atomic chains on the surface of superconducting lead (Pb). Using high-resolution spectroscopic imaging techniques, we show that the onset of superconductivity, which gaps the electronic density of states in the bulk of the Fe chains, is accompanied by the appearance of zero-energy end-states. This spatially resolved signature provides strong evidence, corroborated by other observations, for the formation of a topological phase and edge-bound Majorana fermions in our atomic chains.
Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to observe signatures of Majorana states at the ends of iron atom chains. [Also see Perspective by Lee]

Below the critical field, we observe a persisting zero-bias Kondo resonance that vanishes only for low B or higher temperatures, leaving the room to more robust subgap structures at bias voltages between Δ and 2Δ. For strong and approximately symmetric tunnel couplings, a Josephson supercurrent is observed in addition to the Kondo peak. We ascribe the coexistence of a Kondo resonance and a superconducting gap to a significant density of intragap quasiparticle states, and the finite-bias subgap structures to tunneling through Shiba states.

Using the method of full counting statistics we calculate the conductance and the zero-frequency noise. Using an effective low-energy model, we analyze in detail the Andreev reflection probability as a function of the various system parameters and show that it exhibits a Fano resonance (FR) line shape in the case of a weakly coupled QD as a function of the QD energy level when the two MBS overlap. The asymmetry parameter changes sign as the bias voltage is tuned through the MBS overlap energy. The FR is mirrored as a function of the QD level energy as long as tunneling from the dot to the more distant MBS is negligible. However, if both MBS are coupled to the lead and the QD, the height as well as the asymmetry of the line shapes cease to respect this symmetry. These two exclusive cases uniquely distinguish the coupling to a MBS from the coupling to a fermionic bound state that is shared between the two MBS. We complement the analysis by employing a discretized one-dimensional p-wave superconductor (Kitaev chain) for the quantum wire and show that the features of the effective low-energy model are robust towards a more complete Hamiltonian and also persist at finite temperature.},

Currently, one of the most promising platforms for a topological qubit is in terms of Majorana fermion zero modes (MZMs) in spin-orbit coupled superconducting nanowires. However, the topologically robust operations that are possible with MZMs can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer and are therefore not sufficient for realizing a universal gate set for TQC. Here, we show that an array of coupled semiconductor-superconductor nanowires with MZM edge states can be used to realize a more sophisticated type of non-Abelian defect: a genon in an Ising \${\textbackslash}times\$ Ising topological state. This leads to a possible implementation of the missing topologically protected \${\textbackslash}pi/8\$ phase gate and thus universal TQC based on semiconductor-superconductor nanowire technology.

	abstract = {Quantum Dot Heterostructures Dieter Bimberg, Marius Grundmann and Nikolai N. Ledentsov Institute of Solid State Physics, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany Quantum dots are nanometer-size semiconductor structures, and represent one of the most rapidly developing areas of current semiconductor research as increases in the speed and decreases in the size of semiconductor devices become more important. They present the utmost challenge to semiconductor technology, making possible fascinating novel devices. This important new reference book focuses on the key phenomena and principles. Chapter 1 provides a brief account of the history of quantum dots, whilst the second chapter surveys the various fabrication techniques used in the past two decades, and introduces the concept of self-organized growth. This topic is expanded in the following chapter, which presents a broad review of self-organization phenomena at surfaces of crystals. Experimental results on growth of quantum dot structures in many different systems and on their structural characterization are presented in Chapter 4. Basic properties of the dots relate to their geometric structure and chemical composition. Numerical modeling of the electronic and optical properties of real dots is presented in Chapter 5, together with general theoretical considerations on carrier capture, relaxation, recombination and properties of quantum dot lasers. Chapters 6 and 7 summarize experimental results on electronic, optical and electrical properties. The book concludes by disoussing highly topical results on quantum-dot-based photonic devices - mainly quantum dot lasers. Quantum Dot Heterostructures is written by some of the key researchers who have contributed significantly to the development of the field, and have pioneered both the theoretical understanding of quantum dot related phenomena and quantum dot lasers. It is of great interest to graduate and postgraduate students, and to researchers in semiconductor physics and technology and optoelectronics.},

	abstract = {The temperature-dependent impurity susceptibility for the symmetric Anderson model is calculated for all physically relevant values of its parameters U (the Coulomb correlation energy) and Γ (the impurity-level width). It is shown that, when U{\textgreater}πΓ, for temperatures T{\textless}U(10kB) the symmetric Anderson model exhibits a local moment and that its susceptibility maps neatly onto that of the spin-½ Kondo model with an effective coupling given by ρJeff=−8ΓπU. Furthermore, this mapping is shown for remarkably large values of {\textbar}ρJeff{\textbar}. At very low temperatures (much smaller than the Kondo temperature) the local moment is frozen out, just as for the Kondo model, leading to a strong-coupling regime of constant susceptibility at zero termperature. The results also depict the formation of a local moment from the free orbital as T drops below U, a feature not present in the Kondo model. Finally, when U≪πΓ there is a direct transition from free-orbital regime for T≫Γ to the strong-coupling regime for T≪Γ. The calculations were performed using the numerical renormalization group originally developed by Wilson for the Kondo problem. In addition to the actual numerical calculations, analytic results are presented. In particular, the effective Hamiltonians, i.e., fixed-point Hamiltonian plus relevant and marginal operators, are constructed for the free-orbital, local-moment, and strong-coupling regimes. Analytic formulas for the impurity susceptibility and free energy in all three regimes are developed. The impurity specfic heat in the strong-coupling regime is calculated.},

It is emphasized that the condition for the magnetic state depends on the Coulomb (i.e., exchange self-energy) integral, and that the usual type of exchange alone is not large enough in d-shell ions to allow magnetic moments to be present. We show that the susceptibility and specific heat due to the inner shell electrons show strongly contrasting behavior even in the nonmagnetic state.

Surprisingly, this resonance pinning, resembling, in this sense, a “Kondo resonance,” occurs even when the gate-controlled dot level ɛdot(Vg) is far above or far below ɛF. The calculated conductance G of the dot exhibits an unambiguous signature for the Majorana end mode of the wire: In essence, an off-resonance dot [ɛdot(Vg)≠ɛF], which should have G=0, shows, instead, a conductance e2/2h over a wide range of Vg due to this pinned dot mode. Interestingly, this pinning effect only occurs when the dot level is coupled to a Majorana mode; ordinary fermionic modes (e.g., disorder) in the wire simply split and broaden (if a continuum) the dot level. We discuss experimental scenarios to probe Majorana modes in wires via these leaked/pinned dot modes.},

Majorana bound states (MBSs) are peculiar quasiparticles that may one day become the cornerstone of topological quantum computing. To engineer these states, physicists have used semiconductor nanowires in contact with a superconductor. Although many of the observed properties align with theoretical predictions, a closer look into the creation of MBSs is desirable. Deng et al. fabricated nanowires with a quantum dot at one end that served as a spectrometer for the states that formed inside the superconducting gap of the nanowire. Using this setup, topologically trivial bound states were seen to coalesce into MBSs as the magnetic field was varied.
Science, this issue p. 1557
Hybrid nanowires combining semiconductor and superconductor materials appear well suited for the creation, detection, and control of Majorana bound states (MBSs). We demonstrate the emergence of MBSs from coalescing Andreev bound states (ABSs) in a hybrid InAs nanowire with epitaxial Al, using a quantum dot at the end of the nanowire as a spectrometer. Electrostatic gating tuned the nanowire density to a regime of one or a few ABSs. In an applied axial magnetic field, a topological phase emerges in which ABSs move to zero energy and remain there, forming MBSs. We observed hybridization of the MBS with the end-dot bound state, which is in agreement with a numerical model. The ABS/MBS spectra provide parameters that are useful for understanding topological superconductivity in this system.
Tunneling spectroscopy gives insights into the formation of Majorana bound states in a proximitized indium arsenide nanowire.

The Majorana fermion states (MFSs) formed at the ends of the TS are found to be able to alter the Kondo physics profoundly: For an infinitely long wire where the MFSs do not overlap (εm=0) a finite dot-MFS coupling (Γm) reduces the unitary-limit value of the linear conductance by exactly a factor 3/4 in the weak-coupling regime (Γm{\textless}TK), where TK is the Kondo temperature. In the strong-coupling regime (Γm{\textgreater}TK), on the other hand, the spin-split Kondo resonance takes place due to the MFS-induced Zeeman splitting, which is a genuine many-body effect of the strong Coulomb interaction and the topological superconductivity. We find that the original Kondo resonance is fully restored once the MFSs are strongly hybridized (εm{\textgreater}Γm). This unusual interaction between the Kondo effect and the MFS can thus serve to detect the Majorana fermions unambiguously and quantify the degree of overlap between the MFSs in the TS.},

This is due to the Majorana bound state of the wire leaking into the quantum dot. Here we extend this previous work by investigating the low-temperature quantum transport through an interacting quantum dot connected to source and drain leads and side coupled to a topological wire. We explore the signatures of a Majorana zero mode leaking into the quantum dot for a wide range of dot parameters, using a recursive Green's function approach. We then study the Kondo regime using numerical renormalization group calculations. We observe the interplay between the Majorana mode and the Kondo effect for different dot-wire coupling strengths, gate voltages, and Zeeman fields. Our results show that a “0.5” conductance signature appears in the dot despite the interplay between the leaked Majorana mode and the Kondo effect. This robust feature persists for a wide range of dot parameters, even when the Kondo correlations are suppressed by Zeeman fields and/or gate voltages. The Kondo effect, on the other hand, is suppressed by both Zeeman fields and gate voltages. We show that the zero-bias conductance as a function of the magnetic field follows a well-known universality curve. This can be measured experimentally, and we propose that the universal conductance drop followed by a persistent conductance of 0.5e2/h is evidence of the presence of Majorana-Kondo physics. These results confirm that this “0.5” Majorana signature in the dot remains even in the presence of the Kondo effect.},

	abstract = {Certain one-dimensional Fermi systems have an energy gap in the bulk spectrum while boundary states are described by one Majorana operator per boundary point. A finite system of length L possesses two ground states with an energy difference proportional to exp(- L / l 0 ) and different fermionic parities. Such systems can be used as qubits since they are intrinsically immune to decoherence. The property of a system to have boundary Majorana fermions is expressed as a condition on the bulk electron spectrum. The condition is satisfied in the presence of an arbitrary small energy gap induced by proximity of a three-dimensional p-wave superconductor, provided that the normal spectrum has an odd number of Fermi points in each half of the Brillouin zone (each spin component counts separately).},

	abstract = {The 1937 theoretical discovery of Majorana fermions—whose defining property is that they are their own anti-particles—has since impacted diverse problems ranging from neutrino physics and dark matter searches to the fractional quantum Hall effect and superconductivity. Despite this long history the unambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an outstanding goal. This review paper highlights recent advances in the condensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe that this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail exotic ‘topological’ one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support Majorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one of the key insights that arose during the past few years; namely, that it is possible to ‘engineer’ such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by forming appropriate heterostructures with ordinary s-wave superconductors. Numerous proposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as topological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals and many others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects Majorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes of measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling, Josephson effects and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable properties of condensed matter Majorana fermions—the non-Abelian exchange statistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum computation.},

Here, we report on the realization of a Nb–InSb nanowire–Nb hybrid quantum device and the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak structure in the device. An InSb nanowire quantum dot is formed in the device between the two Nb contacts. Due to the proximity effect, the InSb nanowire segments covered by the superconductor Nb contacts turn to superconductors with a superconducting energy gap ΔInSb ∼ 0.25 meV. A tunable critical supercurrent is observed in the device in high back gate voltage regions in which the Fermi level in the InSb nanowire is located above the tunneling barriers of the quantum dot and the device is open to conduction. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied to the devices, the critical supercurrent is seen to decrease as the magnetic field increases. However, at sufficiently low back gate voltages, the device shows the quasi-particle Coulomb blockade characteristics and the supercurrent is strongly suppressed even at zero magnetic field. This transport characteristic changes when a perpendicular magnetic field stronger than a critical value, at which the Zeeman energy in the InSb nanowire is Ez ∼ ΔInSb, is applied to the device. In this case, the transport measurements show a conductance peak at the zero bias voltage and the entire InSb nanowire in the device behaves as in a topological superconductor phase. We also show that this zero-bias conductance peak structure can persist over a large range of applied magnetic fields and could be interpreted as a transport signature of Majorana fermions in the InSb nanowire.},

Well-separated MZMs should manifest non-Abelian braiding statistics suitable for unitary gate operations for TQC. Recent experimental work, following earlier theoretical predictions, has shown specific signatures consistent with the existence of Majorana modes localised at the ends of semiconductor nanowires in the presence of superconducting proximity effect. We discuss the experimental findings and their theoretical analyses, and provide a perspective on the extent to which the observations indicate the existence of anyonic MZMs in solid-state systems. We also discuss fractional quantum Hall systems (the 5/2 state), which have been extensively studied in the context of non-Abelian anyons and TQC.

	abstract = {How localized electrons interact with delocalized electrons is a central question to many problems in sold-state physics1,2,3. The simplest manifestation of this situation is the Kondo effect, which occurs when an impurity atom with an unpaired electron is placed in a metal2. At low temperatures a spin singlet state is formed between the unpaired localized electron and delocalized electrons at the Fermi energy. Theories predict4,5,6,7 that a Kondo singlet should form in a single-electron transistor (SET), which contains a confined ‘droplet’ of electrons coupled by quantum-mechanical tunnelling to the delocalized electrons in the transistor's leads. If this is so, a SET could provide a means of investigating aspects of the Kondo effect under controlled circumstances that are not accessible in conventional systems: the number of electrons can be changed from odd to even, the difference in energy between the localized state and the Fermi level can be tuned, the coupling to the leads can be adjusted, voltage differences can be applied to reveal non-equilibrium Kondo phenomena7, and a single localized state can be studied rather than a statistical distribution. But for SETs fabricated previously, the binding energy of the spin singlet has been too small to observe Kondo phenomena. Ralph and Buhrman8 have observed the Kondo singlet at a single accidental impurity in a metal point contact, but with only two electrodes and without control over the structure they were not able to observe all of the features predicted. Here we report measurements on SETs smaller than those made previously, which exhibit all of the predicted aspects of the Kondo effect in such a system.},

A dot can be switched from a Kondo system to a non-Kondo system as the number of electrons on the dot is changed from odd to even. The Kondo temperature can be tuned by means of a gate voltage as a single-particle energy state nears the Fermi energy. Measurements of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of a Coulomb-blockaded dot show good agreement with predictions of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium Kondo effects.},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new approach for calculating dynamical properties within the numerical renormalization group. It is demonstrated that the method previously used fails for the Anderson impurity in a magnetic field due to the absence of energy scale separation. The problem is solved by evaluating the Green function with respect to the reduced density matrix of the full system, leading to accurate spectra in agreement with the static magnetization. The new procedure provides a unifying framework for calculating dynamics at any temperature and represents the correct extension of Wilson's original thermodynamic calculation.},

	abstract = {The transport coefficients of the Anderson model are calculated by extending Wilson's numerical renormalization group method to finite-temperature Green functions. Accurate results for the frequency and temperature dependence of the single-particle spectral densities and transport time tau ( omega , T) are obtained and used to extract the temperature dependence of the transport coefficients in the strong-correlation limit of the Anderson model. Results are obtained for values of the local level position ranging from the Kondo regime to the mixed valency and empty orbital regimes. The low-temperature anomalies in the resistivity, rho (T), thermopower, S(T), thermal conductivity, kappa (T), and Hall coefficient, R H (T), are discussed in terms of the behaviour of the spectral densities. At low temperature all quantities exhibit the expected Fermi liquid behaviour, rho (T)= rho 0 (1-c(T/T K ) 2 ), S(T) approximately gamma T, kappa (T)/ alpha T=1+ beta (T/T K ) 2 , R H (T)=-R infinity (1- delta (T/T K ) 2 ). Analytic results based on Fermi liquid theory are derived here for the first time for beta and the numerical results are shown to be consistent with this coefficient. The range of temperatures over which universal behaviour extends is also discussed. Scattering of conduction electrons in higher-angular-momentum, l{\textgreater}0, channels is also considered and an expression is derived for the corresponding transport time and used to discuss the influence of the interference terms between the resonant l=0 and non-resonant l=1 channels on the transport properties. The presence of non-resonant scattering is shown to be particularly important for the thermopower at half filling, where the sign of the thermopower can depend sensitively on the non-resonant phase shift. Finally the relation of the results to experiment is discussed.},
