	abstract = {We study the low energy spectrum and transport properties of a correlated quantum dot coupled between normal and superconducting reservoirs and additionally hybridized with a topological superconducting nanowire, hosting the Majorana end-modes. In this setup the Majorana quasiparticle leaking into the quantum dot can be confronted simultaneously with the on-dot pairing and correlations. We study this interplay, focusing on the quantum phase transition from the spinless (BCS-type) to the spinful (singly occupied) configuration, where the subgap Kondo effect may arise. Using the selfconsistent perturbative treatment for correlations and the unbiased numerical renormalization group calculations we find that the Majorana mode has either constructive or destructive effect on the low-energy transport behavior of the quantum dot, depending on its spin. This spin-selective influence could be verified by means of the polarized STM spectroscopy.},

For an impurity described by the Anderson impurity model, we show that the problem maps onto a variant of the interacting resonant two-level model which, in turn, maps onto the ferromagnetic Kondo model. Both magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities are considered. For magnetic impurities, an analysis relying on bosonization and the numerical renormalization group shows that the system flows to a fixed point characterized by a residual ln2 entropy and anisotropic static and dynamical impurity magnetic susceptibilities. For nonmagnetic impurities, the system flows instead to a fixed point with no residual entropy and we find diamagnetic impurity response at low temperatures. We comment on the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for problems with nonstandard conduction band continua and on the differences which arise when we describe the impurities by either Anderson or Kondo impurity models.},

The tuning algorithm that we develop involves controlling the gate voltages and the superconducting phases. Resonant Andreev spectroscopy allows us to make the tuning adaptive, so that each pair of dots may be tuned independently of the other. The calculated quantized zero bias conductance serves then as a natural proof of the topological nature of the tuned phase.},

The flux through a split Josephson junction controls this interaction via the ratio of Josephson and charging energies, with exponential sensitivity. By switching the interaction on and off in neighboring segments of a Josephson junction array, the non-Abelian braiding statistics can be realized without the need to control tunnel couplings by gate electrodes.},

	abstract = {Topological quantum computation has emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as non-Abelian anyons, meaning that they obey non-Abelian braiding statistics. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations that are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles and then measuring the multiquasiparticle states. The fault tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the nonlocal encoding of the quasiparticle states, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the ν=5∕2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and thin-film superconductors. In this review article, current research in this field is described, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. Both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject are addressed, using the ν=5∕2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

	abstract = {A possible sighting of Majorana states
Nearly 80 years ago, the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana proposed the existence of an unusual type of particle that is its own antiparticle, the so-called Majorana fermion. The search for a free Majorana fermion has so far been unsuccessful, but bound Majorana-like collective excitations may exist in certain exotic superconductors. Nadj-Perge et al. created such a topological superconductor by depositing iron atoms onto the surface of superconducting lead, forming atomic chains (see the Perspective by Lee). They then used a scanning tunneling microscope to observe enhanced conductance at the ends of these chains at zero energy, where theory predicts Majorana states should appear.
Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 547
Majorana fermions are predicted to localize at the edge of a topological superconductor, a state of matter that can form when a ferromagnetic system is placed in proximity to a conventional superconductor with strong spin-orbit interaction. With the goal of realizing a one-dimensional topological superconductor, we have fabricated ferromagnetic iron (Fe) atomic chains on the surface of superconducting lead (Pb). Using high-resolution spectroscopic imaging techniques, we show that the onset of superconductivity, which gaps the electronic density of states in the bulk of the Fe chains, is accompanied by the appearance of zero-energy end-states. This spatially resolved signature provides strong evidence, corroborated by other observations, for the formation of a topological phase and edge-bound Majorana fermions in our atomic chains.
Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to observe signatures of Majorana states at the ends of iron atom chains. [Also see Perspective by Lee]

Below the critical field, we observe a persisting zero-bias Kondo resonance that vanishes only for low B or higher temperatures, leaving the room to more robust subgap structures at bias voltages between Δ and 2Δ. For strong and approximately symmetric tunnel couplings, a Josephson supercurrent is observed in addition to the Kondo peak. We ascribe the coexistence of a Kondo resonance and a superconducting gap to a significant density of intragap quasiparticle states, and the finite-bias subgap structures to tunneling through Shiba states.

	abstract = {We consider a quantum wire containing two Majorana bound states (MBS) at its ends that are tunnel-coupled to a current lead on one side and to a quantum dot (QD) on the other side. Using the method of full counting statistics we calculate the conductance and the zero-frequency noise. Using an effective low-energy model, we analyze in detail the Andreev reflection probability as a function of the various system parameters and show that it exhibits a Fano resonance (FR) line shape in the case of a weakly coupled QD as a function of the QD energy level when the two MBS overlap. The asymmetry parameter changes sign as the bias voltage is tuned through the MBS overlap energy. The FR is mirrored as a function of the QD level energy as long as tunneling from the dot to the more distant MBS is negligible. However, if both MBS are coupled to the lead and the QD, the height as well as the asymmetry of the line shapes cease to respect this symmetry. These two exclusive cases uniquely distinguish the coupling to a MBS from the coupling to a fermionic bound state that is shared between the two MBS. We complement the analysis by employing a discretized one-dimensional p-wave superconductor (Kitaev chain) for the quantum wire and show that the features of the effective low-energy model are robust towards a more complete Hamiltonian and also persist at finite temperature.},
